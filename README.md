# Learn enough C/C++ and data structure & algorithms to dangerous :sunglasses:
This repo is a personal long-time project to implement every popular data structures, algorithms by code C/C++. Once example is labeled by one tag, that description its field. Some fields are:
* Data structures
* Basic Algorithms (sort, search,...)
* Advance Algorithms (D&C, Rec,...)
* Operating System
* Function Example in C/C++
* Discrete Math
* Network Programming
* ...

Happy coding! :octocat:
